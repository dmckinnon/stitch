# Panorama stitching

The aim of this tutorial and program is to go over all the constituent parts, and theory contained in, panorama stitching, 
as well as providing a reference solution.
The best place to start is main.cpp, where each component is used in sequence, and then step into each function or file as necessary. 
Each component has a comment block that I will also explain here, along with reference texts.
