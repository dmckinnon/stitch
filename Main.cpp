	/* Panorama stitching
	
	The aim of this exercise is to learn all the different parts to image stitching. 
	These are:
	- feature detection
	- feature description
	- feature matching 
	     - Do this with a K-D tree
	- optimisation via direct linear transform
	- applying transformations to images RANSAC wooo

	Also:
	- bundle adjustment
	- alpha blending
	- using more than two views

	The overarching aim is to learn first hand more computer vision techniques. This gives
	me a broad knowledge of a lot of skills, whilst also implementing a fun project. 
	An advantage is that we don't need camera calibration here. 

	Best if we pick two images with a relatively small baseline compared to the distance
	from the main object. 

	At the end I should comment the crap out of this for anyone reading in future

	For testing I'm using Adobe's dataset: https://sourceforge.net/projects/adobedatasets.adobe/files/adobe_panoramas.tgz/download
	Reference Implementation of FAST: https://github.com/edrosten/fast-C-src

	TODO:
	- Adaptive threshold for FAST features?
	- Commentary throughout functions
	- Detect features at different scales


	Log:
	- Starting with the theory of FAST features
	- implementing fast features soon i hope, iteration 1
	- FAST features basic version implemented with a threshold of 10. Do we use a dynamic
	  threshold? I'll experiment with different numbers. 15 is working for now.
	- Now score each feature with Shi-Tomasi score (then make descriptors)
	- Iteration one of scoring done, testing now. Need more tweaking
	- Got it at least working. Need a better threshold?
	- Now for feature description. HOG won't work - not orientationally invariant. SURF or SIFT ... 
	  Won't use ORB, want the more difficult route. 
	  Gonna use SIFT - http://aishack.in/tutorials/sift-scale-invariant-feature-transform-features/
	- Non-maximal suppression on features added.
	- Feature orientation added
	- SIFT descriptors added. To be tested ...
